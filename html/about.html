  <p>
    Hello! Iâ€™m Dat!
  </p>
  <p>
    I love creation. I want to create something that everybody can enjoy. That's
    why I become a developer!
  </p>
  <p>
    I have been working for 3 years, specializing in Front-End development. I
    love Javascript, as well as its frameworks jQuery and React.js.
  </p>
  <p>
    My experiences have taught me that understanding "the core" is essential in
    programming, no matter which languages you are using.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also enjoy researching new technology. Learning is a never-ending journey,
    gotta keep learning right?!
